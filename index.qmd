<div style="text-align: justify"> 
         
I'm a graduate statistics student at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and have a deep interest in machine learning engineering and operations. I hold a BA in Economics from the University of St.Gallen, during which I have discovered a passion for discovering meaning in data and which has allows me to connect the rigorous quantitative methods at ETH to the business and economic perspective of the real world.

In my part-time role as a Junior Operations Research Analyst at BKW, I employ predictive modelling techniques and data analysis, predominantly using Python and R and assist the asset optimisation team by creating actionable and digestible insights from data.

In addition to my academic and professional interests, I have a passion for outdoor sports (üèÉ), human-powered (üö≤) and motorised (üèçÔ∏è) two-wheelers, and a background in boxing (ü•ä).

Thank you very much for visiting and feel free to reach out for feedback or to connect over my socials.
